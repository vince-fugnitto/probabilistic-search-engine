# IR-FinalProject

## Objectives

Experiment with web crawling, scrape and index a set of web documents, use the sentiment dictionary
aFinn to associate sentiment values to the index, make document ranking reflect sentiment.

## Due Date

This project has to be demonstrated during lab time December 5, 6, 7. The complete project has to be
submitted by November 26, 2017. A final version has to be submitted by December 5, 2017. The difference between
the first version and the final submission has to be agreed on during lab time by the lab instructor. This project is a
team project that must be developed in groups of 3.

## Description

* starting from pages https://csu.qc.ca/content/student-groups-associations, https://www.concordia.
ca/artsci/students/associations.html, http://www.cupfa.org, http://cufa.net, crawl for links (you
may use crawling tools such as Websphinx but you may also find other tools, such as NYUcrawl. To extract
the text from web pages, consider Boilerpipe. Describe and attribute any tools used. Make sure you obey
the standard for robot exclusion. Your crawler MUST accept as part of its input an upper bound on the total
number of files to be downloaded. In developing, testing, and debugging, this number should be kept as SMALL
as possible. Develop your own closed test set of HTML files for testing and debugging. The final index should
index as many documents as possible.) (5 pts, Attrib 5)

* create an enhanced inverted index, using tf-idf and the sentiment dictionary aFinn (http://www2.imm.dtu.
dk/pubdb/views/publication_details.php?id=6010). Associate sentiment values to each term in your index
vocabulary (each term should have the document frequency and the sentiment value associated in the dictionary
part of the index). Note that you may use any indexer you like. Lucene is allowed, as is your classmatesâ€™ code,
with permission. (5 pts, Attrib 5)

* develop a simple sentiment aggregation function to associate sentiment to individual documents, to queries, or
to collections of documents (3 pts, Attrib 5)

## Functionality to demonstrate 

for a given query, rank the documents by sentiment in the appropriate order. This
means, if the query has overall negative sentiment, rank negative documents higher, for positive or neutral queries,
rank positive documents higher. (4pts, Attrib 5)
You have to demonstrate system components during the final demo, such as crawling, indexing, and ranking. Note
that you should ensure functionality on a subset of accessible pages first, if including all linked pages overwhelms your
setup. Any limitations of the final system have to be clearly discussed in your report.
Experiment with different queries and compare their results. (1pt, Attrib 5)

## Additional questions to answer on the written final report

what was the hardest step? How big is the 
index? How did you define what constitutes a document in your index? What observations did you make during your
experiments? What did you learn from your experience? (1pt for graduate students, 3pts for undergraduate students)

## Deliverables in Moodle

* Code
* Index
* Final report, documenting the design of the code and report on the experiments, the results, and answer the
questions specified above. Individual contributions of each team member have to be specified at the end of the
report.) (1pt, Attrib 6)
